<!-- 
index.html ← my app's HTML entry point
             - shouldn't have much besides the root div, bc React takes over from there
   └── #root ← the single root div inside index.html where my entire React 
               app is mounted
        └── main.jsx ← my app's JS entry point
                       - initializes React and renders the tol-level App component 
                         into the DOM, usually into #root in index.html
                       - main.jsx might import global styles, index.css 
             └── <App /> ← root component of my app for my app's logic and structure 
                       - styled with App.css
                   └── components, routes, etc.

index.css → global styles applied across entire app

<!-- Vite - frontend build that that improves the dev experience compared to
            older tools like CRA or Webpack
- uses native ES modules for near-instant dev server startup
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) - instant updates in the browser when I change code
- pre-bundling with esbuild - fast dependency resolution is Go-based esbuild
- works with React, Vue, Svelte, etc.
- uses Rollup for bundling when building for production 
Webpack 
- slower startup, bundles everything upfront
- slower build speed
-  full or partial rebuilds HMR 
- mature and vast plugin ecosystem
- mature support with Babel -->
